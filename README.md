     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     Unit 5 asks for the first five sections. Unit 6 adds the five below them.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images.

     ⚠️ The confusion matrix especially. The notebook prints one as a markdown
     table, ready to copy. A screenshot of a matrix earns nothing. Paste the
     table.

## What This Does

<!-- Your community, and what your classifier sorts posts into. Three or four
     sentences. -->
This project classifies individual comments from Wikipedia's WikiProject Video
games discussion community, where editors collaborate on video-game articles,
sources, and organization. It sorts each comment by its main purpose: asking a
`question`, offering a `suggestion`, or contributing to the `discussion`. The
classifier uses the comment text, not images or the full conversation. Its
initial dataset comes from a single discussion archive, so it may not represent
the entire community.


---

## Label Taxonomy

<!-- Each label: a one-sentence definition and two real examples from your
     reading. Then your decision rule for the hardest boundary.

     The decision rule is worth a point on its own and it's the thing most
     people leave out. Every taxonomy has a hardest boundary. Name yours. -->

### `question`

**Definition:** A comment explicitly requests information, clarification, help,
or input from other editors about a Wikipedia-related issue.

**Example 1:**
> [ProtoDrake asks about a guideline for game engines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-ProtoDrake-20221012164200-Respiciens-20221012103500)

**Example 2:**
> [Blaze Wolf asks for suggestions for a Did You Know hook.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-Blaze_Wolf-20221010131600-DYK_for_Need_for_Speed_Unbound)

### `suggestion`

**Definition:** A comment recommends a specific action or change that an editor
could take concerning a Wikipedia article, source, or process.

**Example 1:**
> [PerryPerryD recommends gathering more article information before a nomination.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-PerryPerryD-20221010144300-Blaze_Wolf-20221010131600)

**Example 2:**
> [Yeeno proposes a hook about the game's leaked title.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-Yeeno-20221010212600-Blaze_Wolf-20221010131600)

### `discussion`

**Definition:** A comment shares an opinion, explanation, observation, status
update, or agreement without explicitly requesting input or recommending a
specific action.

**Example 1:**
> [Blaze Wolf explains why there is little criticism available yet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-Blaze_Wolf-20221010144500-PerryPerryD-20221010144300)

**Example 2:**
> [Masem explains the convention for including game engines in infoboxes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-Masem-20221012180400-ProtoDrake-20221012164200)

### The hardest boundary

**Which two labels:** `question` and `suggestion`

**Borderline comment:** [ProtoDrake raises a sourcing issue and asks whether a
guideline applies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-ProtoDrake-20221012164200-Respiciens-20221012103500)

**The decision rule:** If a comment explicitly asks others for information,
help, or input, label it `question` even if it also mentions a possible action;
otherwise, use `suggestion` for a specific recommended action and `discussion`
for the remaining comments. A rhetorical question that does not seek an answer
does not by itself make a comment a `question`.

## The Dataset

<!-- Where you collected from, how you labelled, your counts, and three hard
     cases. -->

**Where the posts came from:** Individual comments on [Wikipedia's WikiProject
Video games discussion archive 165](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165),
collected using the MediaWiki API. The CSV's `note` field retains each comment's
permalink (which identifies its author) and the source page revision. Wikipedia
text is licensed under [CC BY-SA](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Terms_of_Use);
preserve attribution and check the applicable license requirements when sharing.
This initial sample comes from one archive and includes related replies, so it
may not represent the whole community and random splitting may place comments
from the same discussion in different splits.

**How I labelled them:** The first 20 comments were labeled independently and
marked `cold`. The remaining 180 were pre-labeled by AI and are marked
`AI pre-labeled; human review pending`; each must still be read and corrected by
the student. Source information is retained in each note.

**Counts per label:**

| Label | Count | Share |
|---|---|---|
| `question` | 47 | 23.5% |
| `suggestion` | 55 | 27.5% |
| `discussion` | 98 | 49% |
| **Total** | 200 | 100% |

These counts include 180 provisional AI labels and will change if labels are
corrected. The AI flagged several automated announcements and a formatting
artifact in their notes for special review.

**Three hard cases**

<!-- Any post that made you pause: what it was, which two labels it could have
     been, and what you chose. These are worth more than the easy 190. -->

These are AI-proposed hard cases and choices; they still need my review.

**1.** [ProtoDrake discusses sourcing and asks about the guideline.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-ProtoDrake-20221012164200-Respiciens-20221012103500)

Could be `question` or `discussion`. The provisional choice is `question`:
although the comment explains a concern, it also explicitly asks for clarification.

**2.** [Blaze Wolf describes an unsourced Pokémon gameplay article and says they are unsure what to do.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-Blaze_Wolf-20221013154000-Gameplay_of_Pokémon)

Could be `question` or `discussion`. The provisional choice is `discussion`:
the comment expresses uncertainty but does not explicitly ask for help.

**3.** [Alyo discusses whether the gameplay article has enough sourcing and proposes a different focus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_165#c-Alyo-20221013155100-Blaze_Wolf-20221013154000)

Could be `suggestion` or `discussion`. The provisional choice is `suggestion`:
the comment proposes focusing more on how gameplay has evolved, not just an assessment of the article.

## The Training Run

<!-- Your starting model, your settings, and anything you changed and why. -->

**Base model:** `distilbert-base-uncased`.

**Settings:** 3 epochs, learning rate 2e-5, batch size 16, maximum 128 tokens,
seed 42; CPU, PyTorch 2.14.1+cu130.

**Anything I changed from the defaults, and why:** The label map and input file
were set in memory to the Wikipedia labels and `labels.csv`; the notebook itself
was not changed. Training hyperparameters were unchanged. Results were written
to a separate run directory to preserve existing root-level results.

**Split sizes:** 139 train / 31 validation / 30 test. The test set has 7
`question`, 8 `suggestion`, and 15 `discussion` examples. With only 7 test
questions, that label's metrics can vary substantially between splits. This run
is provisional because human review of 180 AI-labeled comments is pending.



---

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments — what you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     ⚠️ Plus disclosure of any pre-labelling. If you had a model pre-label a
     batch and then read and corrected every one, say that. It's an allowed
     workflow and disclosing it costs you nothing. Not disclosing it is the
     problem. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:* Small edits and guidance to the Jupyter notebook and how to set up the kernel properly.
- *What came back:* The requested changes.
- *What I changed:* I was able to adapt the notebook and set up the project to use my dataset.

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:* Help collecting and labeling 200 comments and documenting
  difficult label boundaries.
- *What came back:* AI created a collector and source-linked dataset,
  pre-labeled 180 comments, and proposed three hard cases with explanations.
- *What I changed:* I independently labeled the first 20 comments and kept the
  AI-generated labels and hard-case choices marked as provisional. I still need
  to read and correct every pre-labeled comment myself.

**Pre-labelling disclosure:** 180 rows were pre-labeled by AI after the first
20 were labeled cold. Human review and correction of the pre-labels is pending.

## Baseline vs. Trained

<!-- Both models on the same posts. `python baseline.py --trained results.json`
     prints this table for you. -->

|Measure | Baseline | Trained | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall accuracy | 0.600 | 0.500 | -0.100 |
| Macro F1 | 0.552 | 0.222 | -0.330 |
| F1 — `discussion` | 0.667 | 0.667 | +0.000 |
| F1 — `question` | 0.625 | 0.000 | -0.625 |
| F1 — `suggestion` | 0.364 | 0.000 | -0.364 |

**What I predicted before I looked:**
<!-- Milestone 1 asks you to write this BEFORE seeing the trained numbers. A
     prediction made afterwards isn't one. -->

     I predict that it will be better at classifying 'discussion' posts due to the density of their labels within the dataset.

**What the gap actually means:**
<!-- If the baseline matched your trained model, your fine-tuning added
     nothing — and that is a real finding, not a failure. Say it plainly. -->

     Looks like there was no difference in the 'discussion' posts, the fine tuning didn't seem to do to much! I will try to change this to ensure better accuracy.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria across three seeds. The notebook's section 6 prints the
     spread table; the Target and Verdict columns are yours. -->

| Criterion | Target | Seed 42 | Seed 7 | Seed 2024 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Confusion matrix

<!-- ⚠️ TYPED AS A MARKDOWN TABLE. The notebook prints one ready to paste.
     An image of a matrix earns nothing. -->

| true \ predicted | `question` | `suggestion` | `discussion` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `question` |  |  |  |
| `suggestion` |  |  |  |
| `discussion` |  |  |  |

**My biggest off-diagonal number, and what it means:**
<!-- Not "the model made mistakes" — WHICH boundary it didn't learn, and which
     direction. "7 real analysis posts were called hot_take and only 3 went the
     other way" is a direction, not just an error rate. -->



---

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED against LAST UNIT's target. The target has to hold across
     all three seeds, not turn up sometimes. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

<!-- For each miss: the cause, and how you know. The four common causes are:
     too few examples for a label, a boundary you applied inconsistently, a
     genuinely hard label pair, and a task the model can't reach from this
     much data.

     ⚠️ Use your agreement report as evidence. It is the only instrument you
     have that can tell a LABELLING problem from a MODEL problem, and this
     section is graded on whether you used it that way. -->



---

## Agreement Report

<!-- Your rate against the staff set, and every disagreement adjudicated.

     Remember you labelled these 30 under the STAFF taxonomy in
     data/staff_taxonomy.md, not your own — so every argument below is made
     from those definitions and those decision rules. -->

**Agreement rate:** ___ / 30 = ___%

<!-- Nobody grades this number. A 60% who argues every disagreement from the
     stated rules beats a 95% who wrote "staff was right" nine times. Several
     of the 30 were chosen because they're genuinely ambiguous — you should be
     winning some of these. -->

**Disagreements**

<!-- Three lines each: the post, both labels, and who you think is right and
     why — grounded in the staff definitions you were both applying.

     Then sort each into one of three piles:
       (a) the rule covered it and I applied it loosely → a consistency problem
       (b) the rule genuinely doesn't say               → a gap in the definitions
       (c) the rule is ambiguous here and my reading is defensible → argue it.
           This is a legitimate win.

     Pile (a) is the one that matters most for your diagnosis: if you applied a
     written rule two different ways on 30 posts, that is direct evidence about
     what you did across your own 200. -->

**1.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Staff said / I said:*
>
> *My call, and why:*
>
> *Which pile:*

**2.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Staff said / I said:*
>
> *My call, and why:*
>
> *Which pile:*

**What the pattern in my disagreements tells me:**

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Which diagnosis pointed at it:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Seed 42 | Seed 7 | Seed 2024 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it didn't, say so. Relabelling that didn't help is a genuinely
     interesting result and earns full credit. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped. -->



**The gap between what I meant my labels to capture and what the model
learned:**
<!-- Two sentences. Your confusion matrix is the evidence. -->
